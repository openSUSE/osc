   following error:
     Your working copy '.' is in an inconsistent state.
     Please run 'osc repairwc .' (Note this might _remove_
     files from the .osc/ dir). Please check the state
     of the working copy afterwards (via 'osc status .')
   Simply run "osc repairwc" which might fetch files from the api
   or delete some files from the storedir (.osc/). It won't touch
   locally modified files. For more information see section
   "WORKING COPY INCONSISTENT" in the README.

- .oscrc: make tilde expansion work on the packagecachedir setting
- osc update / checkout: don't check out a working copy, or update an existing
  one, when a source link cannot be applied [bnc#409373]


0.106:

- osc rdiff / osc submitreq show: diff the _expanded_ sources [bnc#408267]
- osc submitreq list: show author's name
- osc submitreq: shortcut alias 'sr' added


0.105:

- osc submitreq list:
   - can now be called without parameters, applying to the working copy then.
   - calling it in a project directory is also possible now.
   - output was improved. Newest requests are listed first.
- osc submitreq delete: a new action which has been added
- osc submitreq list/create: use api URL from the working copy
- osc meta: editing returns the API error description instead of a plain HTTP
  error if available
- osc copypac: use the correct userid when copying to another api host
- osc importsrcpkg: disable signature check when getting data from a rpm file
- osc linkpac: --revision option added.
- osc search: added option -i|--involved, to show in which projects/packages
  a developer is involved
- osc build: double check the buildinfo for local builds. Refuse to build for
  architectures that are not supported by the host
- osc buildhist: change the output into a format which better matches actual
  RPM filenames.
- osc commit: give commit message tempfiles a ".diff" suffix, so syntax
  highlighting automatically works in capable editors
- other bug fixes:
  - don't expand/unexpand if the working copy has local modifications - this is
    an ugly workaround for #399247 but this way the working copy isn't screwed up
  - work around a bug which causes packages to be cached locally under the
    "None" architecture (and therefore causing issues when building for more
    than one architecture via osc build).
  - don't create _linkerror files in working copies
  - better error handling (mostly printing more details) in a number of cases
  - show error messages from the API also for type 500 errors


0.104:
- osc update: after update, reset the revision when updating multiple package.
  Fixes "404: Not Found" type errors when updating an entire project. [bnc#399177]
- more/better error messages in some error scenarios
- osc wipebinaries: add missing check for commandline arguments, which could
  cause a PACKAGE argument to be ignored
- fixed make_diff in order to avoid errors when committing a new package
  (created with mkpac)


0.103:

- osc submitreq create: simplify by make osc guess needed parameters, if
  there is a working copy and it is a source link.
- osc submitreq create: don't stop on packages that have a devel project
  defined, if the submit actually comes from that project.
- osc checkout: checkout of source links is now done in expanded form per
  default. The new option --unexpand-link can be used to get the raw link file.
- show the API's error message for HTTP 403 (Forbidden) replies.


0.102:

- osc branch: Show the actually created branch project name, not
  a guessed one.  Add --nodevelproject.
- osc submitreq: look up the develproject of the target, and if
  there is one, don't create the request, unless forced with
  --nodevelproject.
- make the global -d option work better under certain circumstances

0.101:

- add osc branch command, using the branch API call to branch a package to
  home:poeml:branches:PRJ/PKG
- osc commit now opens $EDITOR for commit message
- improved error handling, when API returns HTTP status code 400 (bad request)
- osc status: implement -q/--quiet switch
- osc info: slightly more verbose
- osc deletepac: allow deletion of multiple packages at once
- make "osc meta prjconf <project> -e" work again (probably caused by r3702)


0.100:

- improved error handling (babysitter.py wrapper, oscerr.py exception classes)
  Tracebacks are mostly suppressed now. To enable them, use
       -t, --traceback    print call trace in case of errors
  or set traceback=1 in .oscrc.
- other new global options for debugging:
       --debugger         jump into the debugger before executing anything
       --post-mortem      jump into the debugger in case of errors
       -d, --debug        print info useful for debugging
- make way for more seamless osc version updates (the .osc directory in working copies
  will have its own versioning in the future)
- osc rprjresults and osc rresults: new commands to show remote build results
- osc build: added --baselibs and --jobs options
- osc copypac: added --keep-maintainers switch
- osc maintainer: new -D/--devel-project switch
- BUILD_DIST environment variable will be ignored (bnc#359846)
  The following environment variables can still be used:
  * OSC_SU_WRAPPER overrides the setting of su-wrapper.
  * OSC_BUILD_ROOT overrides the setting of build-root.
  * OSC_PACKAGECACHEDIR overrides the setting of packagecachedir.


0.99+patches (interim releases, including Wed Apr  2 16:36:40 CEST 2008)

- new command submitreq, to handle "submit requests" (next generation build
  service feature). See http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Collaboration 
- new link handling:
  add support for handling linked packages in expanded form. They
  can be checked out, updated (expanding or unexpanding them),
  and built locally.
  Newly introduced options are:
  * osc checkout: --expand-link
  * osc update: --expand-link and --unexpand-link
- new feature: package tracking. It's not enabled by default and
   needs to be switched on with do_package_tracking=1 in .oscrc.

- ls: add -b option to list binaries
- make osc library simpler to use from external scripts
- new importfromsrcpkg command, to import a package src.rpm from file or URL
- new req command, to issue arbitrary requests to the API

0.97:
- added initial revision handling:
    - extended "osc co prj pac" to checkout a specific revision of pac
    - extended "osc up" to update to a specific revision
    - extended "osc diff" to diff the working copy against a
      specific revision on the server. NOTE: comparing two
      server-side revisions (osc diff -r 11:12) is currently
      not supported!
- load subcommands from /var/lib/osc-plugins/ or ~/.osc-plugins/
- updatepacmetafromspec scans for spec files automatically. Added --specfile option to updatepacmetafromspec.
- wipebinaries: allow to wipe all binaries of packages for which the build is disabled
- addremove: ignore foo.rXX, foo.mine for files which are in 'C' state
- ls: add verbose option to print extra information for packages
- for all server-side commands, allow arguments "foo/bar" instead of "foo bar"
- new wipebinaries and abortbuild commands, by courtesy of Marcus Huewe

- build: add --userootforbuild option
- build: implement -x/--extra-pkgs option (passed to backend and included in buildinfo result)
- make filling out of username in templates work again
- don't try to delete projects, as long it is not implemented in the backend
- use new API route for downloading binaries also in configured URLs
- make deletepac work again


0.96:
- following suggestions by Christian Boltz and Michal Marek, osc now memorizes
  where a working copy was checked out from, saving the api server url to
  .osc/_apiurl.
- implement 'info' subcommand
- use new api routes in all places
- buildhistory works again
- copypac: implement package copy from one buildservice instance to another
  (--to-apiurl option)
- the results subcommand now handles multiple <working copy> arguments
- build: implement --prefer-pkgs and --keep-pkgs option
- applied patch from Michael Marek, fixing all places where error
  messages were printed to stdout instead of stderr. [#239404]
- osc is now easier to work with when using alternative API servers. The
  configured server can be overriden with -A <url> on the commandline.
  "apisrv" in the config takes a URL now, so the variable "scheme" which was
  needed in addition before becomes obsolete. For backward compatibility, a
  hostname (and scheme variable) are accepted like before. Likewise, the auth
  sections in the config take a URL now, or a hostname:port to keep old config
  working. HTTP or HTTPS scheme is determined from the URL. Credentials must be
  configured in .oscrc.
- build: use actual api server in urllist for downloading, instead of hardcoded
  api.opensuse.org [#265211].


0.95:
- rewrite the internal HTTP handling
  - save and reuse HTTP server cookies, which can speed up HTTP requests up about
    5 times in an iChain setup
  - adding http_GET/POST/PUT/DELETE() functions, which dispatch to
    http_request(), and use them everywhere
  - removing othermethods.py
  - keeping urlopen(), in case it is used from externally, but have it print out
    a "depracated" message
  - finally, global option -H enables HTTP traffic debugging
- implement "rebuild all failed packages", via --failed option in rebuildpac
  subcommand
- status -v shows all files, including unmodified ones
- suppress the legend in prjresults by default (show with -l)
- --version shows the program version number
- fix the commit subcommand's argument handling. The following works correctly
  now: osc ci ../test/onlyinwc `pwd` fstab ../test/f2
- fix the download progress meter to work with small terminals [#266989]
- update: when updating multiple packages, print each package name
- make 'results' subcommand many times faster, by making only a single request
- prjresults: sort package names
- build: run with --norootforbuild, thereby defaulting to build as abuild user
- build: fix (harmless) errors showing up in the build log during buildsystem
  setup, by using the new <bdep> preinstall and runscripts attributes
- update: when updating, don't delete files with local modifications
- let the diff subcommand return 1 if differences were found
- fix important bug, which could lead to overwriting local modifications when
  upstream changes are merged in
- if a merge fails, the store copy must be updated neverthelesss
- fix testsuite and add testcase for successful merging
- sort output of 'status' (unknown files first, filenames alphabetically)
- core: added class "metadata" (merge from Susannes /branches/froh/reponator/)
- added command alias 'stat' for 'status', like in svn
- improved documentation/examples (Lars + Susanne)
- print usage info if 'co' is called without arguments

0.9:
- "iChain-ready" (works with API server now using iChain authentication)
- add runtime check for build.rpm version, so the rpm package dependency is
  no longer required
- add 'edituser' command for editing the metadata of a user account. It tries
  to create a user if it doesn't exist yet. A new command 'usermeta' replaces
  'id' respectively 'userid'.
- rewrite configuration handling. Now the API server can be set in .oscrc
- ignore '.gitignore', '.pc', '*~' (now using filename matching [#208969]
- fix 'status' to work with project directories as arguments
- fix 'status <filename>'
- 'rebuildpac' now accepts additional repo and arch argument. Note:
  the syntax has changed.
- add 'prjresults' command to display aggregated build status over
  an entire project
- add 'deleteprj' command (the API server doesn't seem to support
  it yet, though)
- change 'buildhistory' to display human-readable text
- add 'copypac' subcommand, to copy a complete package to a new package, possibly cross-project
- don't die if user tries to 'add' a file which is already versioned
- don't die if 'addremove' encounters directories
- urlopen(): for server return code 500, print out the reply body

0.8:
- build: use configuration from *local* specfile (e.g. BuildRequires)
- build: let envvars OSC_SU_WRAPPER and OSC_BUILD_ROOT override config
- build: allow 'dynamical' build-root setting by using %(repo)s and %(arch)s
- add 'createpac/editpac' and 'createprj/editprj' subcommands which
  are similar to 'editmeta' but should be more logical to find
- added 'deletepac' subcommand
- added 'buildhistory' subcommand (formerly 'history'). This only
  gives out raw xml at this time
- added 'linkpac' subcommand
- added ".git" to the excluded files
- adapt to API changes
- fixed issue with uploading files when an intercepting web proxy was
  in between osc and the api server
- fixed creation of new packages/projects

0.7:
- initial support for local builds (subcommand 'build')
- better error handling
- new subcommands buildconfig, buildinfo, repos
- remove requirement on pyxml package
- editmeta: add examples for package/project templates
- add support for streaming the build log (thanks to Christoph Thiel)
- add 'rebuildpac' subcommand
- add 'repourls' subcommand
- don't diff binary files
- don't try to merge binary files
- add a preliminary 'updatepacmetafromspec' subcommand, which takes package
  metadata from a specfile
- fix profiling wrapper
- set User-agent
- bugfixes:
  - fix handling of filenames with '+' signs
  - make 'resolved' more robust
  - fix merge on 'update' if called from another directory
  - display reason for build status is 'broken'
  - handle HTTP error codes != 404 when reading metadata in edit_meta()
  - handle 'project not found' error in show_project_meta()


0.6:
- diff bugfix: sometimes displayed diff against obsolete files
- update bugfixes: fix update of working copy when adding a file from upstream
  which is missing locally; fix update in directory with unmodified files:
  don't try to merge if upstream file wasn't changed at all
- add: make it faster


0.5:
- help :-)
- add 'editmeta' subcommand: Edit project/package meta information, creating
  new project or package if it doesn't exist. The user interface is $EDITOR
- fix status letter for files merged on update (in analogy to svn , it is
  either G or U)
- if an old _files listing without any metadata is found, don't bother the user
  with it
- make all subcommands properly importable functions
- bug in 'resolved' command fixed, which wouldn't clear the conflict state of a file


0.4:
- allow 'up' inside a project directory (will automatically pull in all new
  packages). (For past checkouts, you may need to put the project name into
  $prjdir/.osc/_project yourself).
- checkout: preserve mtimes
- add diff3 merge support. Locally modified files are merged with upstream changes
  if possible, and go into Conflict state if that fails.
- add 'resolved' command to be used after manual merging.


0.3:
- use the new file metadata, which provides checksum, size and mtime
- faster 'status', 'update', 'diff'
- improve argument handling, now e.g. 'osc up *' is possible
- on first usage, ask for username and password and store them in .oscrc
  (.netrc can still be used)
