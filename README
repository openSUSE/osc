osc -- opensuse-commander with svn like handling


Patches can be submitted via
 * mail to opensuse-buildservice@opensuse.org
 * Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.novell.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=openSUSE.org&component=BuildService
 * or the official Git repository on Github:

INSTALLATION:

RPM packages are here (rpm-md repository):
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tools/

To install from git, do

        python setup.py build
        python setup.py install
        # create a symlink 'osc' in your path pointing to osc.py.
        ln -s osc-wrapper.py /usr/bin/osc

Alternatively, you can directly use osc-wrapper.py from the source dir
(which is easier if you develop on osc).


The program needs the cElementTree python module installed. On SUSE, the
respective package is called python-elementtree (before 10.2: python-xml).
For local building, you will need python-urlgrabber in addition. Those are
standard package on SUSE Linux since a while. If your version is too old, you
can find python-elementtree and python-urlgrabber here:
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/python/



CONFIGURATION:

When you use it for the first time, it will ask you for your username and
password, and store it in ~/.oscrc.


CONFIGURATION MIGRATION (only affects versions >= 0.114):

Version 0.114 got some cleanups for the configfile handling and therefore some
options are now deprecated, namely:
* apisrv
* scheme

One new option was added:
* apiurl = <protocol>://<somehost> # use this as the default apiurl. If this
option isn't specified the default (https://api.opensuse.org) is used.

So far osc still has some backward compatibility for these options but it might
get removed in the future that's why it issues a deprecation warning in case
one of those options is still in use.

The new configuration scheme looks like the following:
 # entry for an apiurl
 [<protocol>://<apiurl>]
 user = <username>
 password = <password>
 ...

'''Before starting the migration please save your ~/.oscrc file!'''

If the migration doesn't work for whatever reason feel free to send me an email
or ask on the opensuse-buildservice mailinglist or in the #opensuse-buildservice
irc channel.

=== Migration case I (apisrv only) ===
The apisrv option is used to specify the default apihost. If apisrv isn't
specified at all the default ("api.opensuse.org") is used.
The current [general] section looks like this:
 [general]
 ...
 apisrv = <somehost>
 # or
 apisrv = <protocol>://<somehost>

apisrv got superseded by the new apiurl option which looks like this:
 [general]
 ...
 apiurl = <protocol>://<somehost>

If apisrv has no "<protocol>" https is used. Make sure all apiurl sections have
the new format which is described above. Afterwards apisrv can be removed.

=== Migration case II (scheme only) ===
The current [general] section looks like this:
 [general]
 ...
 scheme = <protocol>

This means every apiurl section which don't have the new format which is
described above for instance
 [<somehost>]
 user = <username>
 password = <password>
 ...

has to be converted to
 [<protocol>://<somehost>]
 user = <username>
 password = <password>
 ...

Afterwards the scheme option can be removed from the [general] section (it
might be the case that some sections already have the correct format).

=== Migration case III (apisrv and scheme) ===
The current [general] section looks like this:
 [general]
 ...
 apisrv = <somehost>
 scheme = <protocol>

Both options can be removed if all apiurl sections have the new format which is
described above. So basically just adjust all apiurl sections (it might be the
case that some sections already have the correct format).


KEYRING USAGE

Osc now can store passwords in keyrings instead of ~/.oscrc. To use it,
you need python-keyring and either python-keyring-kde or -gnome.

If you want to switch to using a keyring you need to delete apiurl section
from ~/.oscrc and you will be asked for credentials again, which will be then
stored in the keyring application.


WORKING COPY INCONSISTENT (only affects version >= 0.130)

osc's working copy handling was rewritten in 0.130. Thus some
consistency checks were added. As a result osc might complain
that some old working copies are in an inconsistent state:
 Your working copy '.' is in an inconsistent state.
 Please run 'osc repairwc .' (Note this might _remove_
 files from the .osc/ dir). Please check the state
 of the working copy afterwards (via 'osc status .')
To fix this simply run "osc repairwc ." as suggested in the
error message. Note that "osc repairwc ." might need to contact
the api in order to fetch some missing files. Also it might remove
some files from the storedir (.osc/) but it won't touch any locally
modified files.
If it DOES NOT fix the problem please create a bug report and attach
your working copy to the bug (if possible).


USAGE EXAMPLES:
(online at http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OSC )

To list existing content on the server
 osc ls                                # list projects
 osc ls Apache                         # list packages in a project
 osc ls Apache subversion              # list files of package of a project

Check out content
 osc co Apache                         # entire project
 osc co Apache subversion              # a package
 osc co Apache subversion foo          # single file

Update a working copy
 osc up
 osc up [pac_dir]                      # update a single package by its path
 osc up *                              # from within a project dir, update all packages
 osc up                                # from within a project dir, update all packages
                                       #   AND check out all newly added packages

If an update can't be merged automatically, a file is in 'C' (conflict)
state, and conflicts are marked with special <<<<<<< and >>>>>>> lines.
After manually resolving the problem, use
 osc resolved foo

Upload change content
 osc ci                                # current dir
 osc ci <dir>
 osc ci file1 file2 ...

Show the status (which files have been changed locally)
 osc st
 osc st <directory>
 osc st file1 file2 ...

Mark files to be added or removed on the next 'checkin'
 osc add file1 file2 ...
 osc rm file1 file2 ...

Adds all new files in local copy and removes all disappeared files.
 osc addremove

Generates a diff, to view the changes
 osc diff                              # current dir
 osc diff file1 file2 ...

Shows the build results of the package
 osc results
 osc results [repository]

Shows the log file of a package (you need to be inside a package directory)
 osc log <repository> <arch>

Shows the URLs of .repo files which are packages sources for Yum/YaST/smart
 osc repourls [dir]

Triggers a package rebuild for all repositories/architectures of a package
 osc rebuildpac [dir]

Shows available repository/build targets
 osc repository

Shows the configured repository/build targets of a project
 osc repository <project>

Shows meta information
 osc meta Apache
 osc meta Apache subversion
 osc id username

Edit meta information
(Creates new package/project if it doesn't exist)
 osc editmeta Apache
 osc editmeta Apache subversion

Update package meta data with metadata taken from spec file
 osc updatepacmetafromspec <dir>


There are other commands, which you may not need (they may be useful in scripts):
 osc repos
 osc buildconfig
 osc buildinfo


Locally build a package (see 'osc help build' for more info):
 osc build <repo> <arch> specfile [--clean|--noinit]


Update a package to a different sources (directory foo_package_source):
 cp -a foo_package_source foo; cd foo; osc init <prj> <pac>; osc addremove; osc ci; cd $OLDPWD; rm -r foo



HINT FOR W3M USERS

Putting the following in the file ~/.w3m/passwd will make
w3m know the credentials for the buildservice servers:

"""
host api.opensuse.org
  port 80
  realm Authentication required
  login foo
  password bar

host build.opensuse.org
  port 80
  realm openSUSE Build Service
  login foo
  password bar
"""

chmod 0600 ~/.w3m/passwd


NOTES about the testsuite

A new test suite has been created and should run via doing
# cd tests
# python suite.py
