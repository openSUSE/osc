FIXME: 
 - more command inconsistencies:
     osc request show
       -B, --bugowner      also show requests about packages where I am bugowner
     osc my 
       -b, --bugowner      restrict listing to items where the user is bugowner
     osc list
       -b, --binaries      list built binaries instead of sources
     osc search
       -B PROJECT, --baseproject=PROJECT
       --binary            search binary packages
       -b, --bugowner      as -i, but only bugowner

     osc checkout
       -c, --current-dir   place PACKAGE folder in the current directory instead
                           of a PROJECT/PACKAGE directory
     osc branch
       -c, --checkout      Checkout branched package afterwards ('osc bco' is a
                           shorthand for this option)
     # that means the branch checkout to cwd is not possible



CRITICAL:
 - webpage can create a _link in a fully populated package.
   Need to prevent his somehow.

 - canonical option parser.
   -A, -e, -u, -E <n>, should be univeral to all subconmmands that work on prj/pkg objects.
   With all subcommands that work on prj/pkg, the following should all be synonyms:
   -A apiurl prj pkg
   -A apiurl --project prj --package=pkg
   -A apiurl prj/pkg
   -A apiurl prj:pkg
   apiurl/source/prj/pkg
   The current working directory or its descendants should provide defaults
   for apiurl, prj and/or pkg.

MAJOR:

NORMAL:

  - split functionality that needs prj/pac as commandline arguments into a seperate tool (oscremote? osc -r?)
    (update: we have some commands meanwhile which exist in an alternate form,
    prefixed with r, which works remotely. E.g. rbuildlog, rprjresults, rresults)
  - status: implement -u option as in svn          [3]
  - implement (svn-like) switch command
  - implement 'mv' command
  - commit: check if errors during PUT are handled sensibly, so the change is
    not committed to localmeta
  - add switch to commit to change repository options, like to e.g. disable publishing?
  - implement optional logging to .osc/log, which could be useful for debugging bugs like
    the one where api.opensuse.org sends empty replies (a hard-to-catch one)


MINOR:

  - osc checkout should display file download progress (bnc#442115)
  - adjust zsh completion to work with cmdln.py implementation
  - add support for adding tags to packages?




JW:
FIXME: osc bco ignores --nodevelproject ??
FIXME: osc co overwrites local changes without warning.
FIXME: when branching, the user should be added to bugowner, for the branch project.
FIXME: 'osc rq' shall default to 'osc rq list -M -B -s all',
       where -B shows requests related to packages where I am the bugowner.
FIXME: 'osc log openSUSE:Factory PKG' should also point to the bsdevelproject

osc addrepo - obsolete zypper ar
 => hm, addrepo could be used also to add a repo to a project. These functionalities
    should not conflict
osc install - obsolete zypper in
  -

- german umlaut characters הצ do not work in the message for osc submitpac.
  404 not found, and no request sent.
- implement fedora style 'osc mock'  - this requires anonymous read-only access to the build server.
  this could use http://tmp.vuntz.net/opensuse-packages/browse.py?project=openSUSE:Factory
  as a hacky solution, while we are waiting on fate#306192
  => we will not make rpm downloads anonymous possible, this would create too high load on the server.
     Please improve build script instead.
