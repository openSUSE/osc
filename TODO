CRITICAL:
 - webpage can create a _link in a fully populated package.
   Need to prevent his somehow.

 - canonical option parser.
   -A, -e, -u, -E <n>, should be univeral to all subconmmands that work on prj/pkg objects.
   With all subcommands that work on prj/pkg, the following should all be synonyms:
   -A apiurl prj pkg
   -A apiurl --project prj --package=pkg
   -A apiurl prj/pkg
   -A apiurl prj:pkg
   apiurl/source/prj/pkg
   The current working directory or its descendants should provide defaults 
   for apiurl, prj and/or pkg.

MAJOR:

NORMAL:

  - improvements submit requests:
    - create: enforce message
    - for done requests, show accept/reject messages also

  - split functionality that needs prj/pac as commandline arguments into a seperate tool (oscremote? osc -r?)
    (update: we have some commands meanwhile which exist in an alternate form,
    prefixed with r, which works remotely. E.g. rbuildlog, rprjresults, rresults)
  - status: implement -u option as in svn          [3]
  - implement (svn-like) switch command
  - implement 'mv' command
  - commit: check if errors during PUT are handled sensibly, so the change is
    not committed to localmeta	
  - add switch to commit to change repository options, like to e.g. disable publishing?
  - implement optional logging to .osc/log, which could be useful for debugging bugs like
    the one where api.opensuse.org sends empty replies (a hard-to-catch one)


MINOR: 

  - osc checkout should display file download progress (bnc#442115)
  - new command: osc listbinaries [<project>] [<package>]
    listing the built package, either as URLs or just the filenames?        	[1]
    there is ls -b:
     % osc ls -b home:poeml scapy -r openSUSE_Factory -a x86_64
    scapy-1.0.4-12.13.noarch.rpm
    scapy-1.0.4-12.13.src.rpm
    but it works packagewise. A project wide binary listing would also be cool
  - adjust zsh completion to work with cmdln.py implementation
  - add support for adding tags to packages?




JW:
FIXME: osc co overwrites local changes without warning.
FIXME: when branching, the user should be added to bugowner, for the branch project.
FIXME: 'osc rq' shall default to 'osc rq list -M -B -s all', 
       where -B shows requests related to packages where I am the bugowner.
FIXME: 'osc log openSUSE:Factory PKG' should also point to the bsdevelproject

osc addrepo - obsolete zypper ar
 => hm, addrepo could be used also to add a repo to a project. These functionalities
    should not conflict
osc install - obsolete zypper in
  -

- german umlaut characters הצ do not work in the message for osc submitpac.
  404 not found, and no request sent.
- implement fedora style 'osc mock'  - this requires anonymous read-only access to the build server.
  this could use http://tmp.vuntz.net/opensuse-packages/browse.py?project=openSUSE:Factory
  as a hacky solution, while we are waiting on fate#306192
  => we will not make rpm downloads anonymous possible, this would create too high load on the server.
     Please improve build script instead.
